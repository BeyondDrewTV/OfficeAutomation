# Current Build Pass

Last Updated: 2026-03-25

## Active Pass
Pass 85 -- Offer Packaging + Deployment Readiness layer

## Status
Pass 85 complete. Frontend + API + durable lead-memory persistence shipped in one cohesive pass.

## What Pass 85 Builds
- Conversations panel now includes an operator-visible Offer + Deployment Readiness block
- Fixed package menu (5 standard Copperline offers):
  - Missed Call Recovery
  - Lead Intake + Routing
  - Follow-Up Reactivation
  - Review Request System
  - Estimate / Job Status Communication
- Deterministic best-fit recommendation (operator can accept or override)
- Lifecycle handoff stage selector:
  discovered -> drafted -> contacted -> replied -> call booked -> proposal ready -> won -> deployment pending -> live
- Deployment checklist:
  intake complete, phone/vendor access collected, copy approved, routing logic defined, testing complete, live
- New API endpoint: `POST /api/update_delivery_profile` (lead-memory only; no queue mutation)
- `GET /api/conversation_queue` now returns normalized `delivery_profile` for replied leads
- Durable storage in `lead_engine/data/lead_memory.json` via new `lead_memory` helper functions

**Files changed:**
- `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html`
- `lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
- `lead_engine/lead_memory.py`

**Protected-system status:** unchanged. No edits to queue schema, sender core, scheduler core, or run orchestrator.

## Verification Completed
1. `python -m py_compile lead_engine/lead_memory.py lead_engine/dashboard_server.py`
2. JS parse check of `lead_engine/dashboard_static/index.html` script block via Node `vm.Script`
3. Flask test client check:
   - `GET /api/conversation_queue` returns 200
   - `POST /api/update_delivery_profile` accepts valid payload and returns normalized profile
